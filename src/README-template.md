### What I learned

This project proved to be quite challenging, yet it turned out to be incredibly enlightening. It pushed me to delve into unfamiliar territory, such as TypeScript and APIs. Through this process, I've acquired a wealth of new knowledge. TypeScript, for instance, revealed its power in elevating code quality by introducing static typing, which minimized errors and enhanced overall robustness. Additionally, I delved into the realm of APIs, mastering the art of fetching data to integrate within the project.

Amidst these new discoveries, I honed my skills in conditional rendering. By deftly employing ternary operators, I was able to infuse dynamism and accuracy into my application. The experience has undoubtedly broadened my skill set and enriched my understanding of these technologies.

### Continued development

I'm continuing to focus my efforts on TypeScript and APIs. Mastering TypeScript's type system has proven to significantly enhance my code quality, and I'm excited to deepen my understanding. APIs have opened up a world of possibilities in terms of data integration, and I'm eager to explore more complex use cases.
